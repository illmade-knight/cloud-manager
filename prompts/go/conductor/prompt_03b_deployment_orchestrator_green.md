# **Prompt 03: Implementation for DeploymentManager**

**Objective:** Generate the implementation for the `DeploymentManager`. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined unit tests, especially the concurrency requirements.

**TDD Phase:** Green

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the `orchestration/deploymentorchestrator.go` file.

I have provided a complete unit test file (`deploymentorchestrator_test.go`). Your implementation **must** make all the tests pass by correctly orchestrating the `ContainerDeployer` to build and deploy services in parallel.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer specializing in writing concurrent, robust, and production-grade orchestration logic.

**Your Specific Task:** Generate the complete code for `orchestration/deploymentorchestrator.go`.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests.**
* **(L2-1.4) Parallel Execution:** The `BuildAllServices` and `DeployApplicationServices` methods **must** be implemented to run their core tasks concurrently. You **must** use a `sync.WaitGroup` and channels to:
    1.  Launch a separate goroutine for each service to be built or deployed.
    2.  Wait for all goroutines to complete.
    3.  Safely collect the results (image URIs or service URLs) from a result channel.
    4.  Safely aggregate any errors from an error channel.
* **(L2-1.1) Orchestration Logic:**
    * The `BuildAllServices` method must correctly iterate through all dataflows in the architecture to find every service with a `Deployment` spec.
    * The `DeployApplicationServices` method must correctly filter for services within the specified dataflow and enrich their `DeploymentSpec` with runtime environment variables (like the `SERVICE_DIRECTOR_URL`) before passing it to the deployer.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1.  **The Specification:** `orchestration/deploymentorchestrator_test.go`
2.  **The Contract:** `deployment/containerdeployer.go`
3.  **The Schema:** `servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go`

## Prompt Changelog

### RV_20250901

This is the initial version of the prompt for the `DeploymentManager` implementation. It requires the implementation to use a robust concurrency pattern (`WaitGroup` + channels) to orchestrate parallel builds and deployments.
