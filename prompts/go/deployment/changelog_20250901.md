### **Introduction: The Purpose and Intent of the Deployment Refactor**

The refinement of the deployment package prompts represents the culmination of our methodology. The goal was to apply our mature "Red-Green-Refine" process to the most complex component of the system: the multi-stage, multi-service "source-to-URL" pipeline.

The intent of this refactor was to create prompts capable of generating a highly-decoupled and testable orchestrator. This was achieved through these core principles:

* **Decomposition of Complexity:** We broke down the monolithic task of deployment into its constituent parts (managing artifacts, deploying to Cloud Run, orchestrating the build). Each part received its own dedicated prompt cycle, ensuring each piece was well-defined and testable.
* **Solidifying the Hybrid Testing Strategy:** This package serves as the blueprint for our hybrid testing approach. The prompts mandate a comprehensive **unit test** to validate the complex orchestration logic in isolation, and a separate, robust **integration test** to verify the entire live pipeline from source code to a running service.
* **Enforcing a Clean Orchestrator Pattern:** The prompts were designed to enforce a clean architectural pattern where the main CloudBuildDeployer acts as a pure orchestrator, delegating all external communication to a set of internal, mockable adapters. This makes the core logic clear, concise, and easy to maintain.

### **Deployment Package Prompt Changelog**

This changelog summarizes the creation and refinement of the full prompt suite for the deployment package.

### **Core Process & Architectural Refinements**

* **Created the deployment Preprompt (prompt\_00\_deployment\_preprompt.md):** A master context prompt was created to define the package's multi-stage pipeline and establish the key architectural patterns before any code was generated.
* **Formalized the Orchestrator with Internal Adapters Pattern:** The prompts enforce a clean separation of concerns. The main CloudBuildDeployer contains only orchestration logic and depends on a set of unexported, internal interfaces. The concrete implementations for these interfaces (the adapters) are co-located in the same file, keeping the provider-specific logic tightly encapsulated.
* **Applied the Hybrid Testing Strategy:** The prompts for the main CloudBuildDeployer mandate the creation of both a unit test (using mocks for the internal adapters) and a comprehensive integration test that runs the full pipeline against live GCP services.

### **Component-Specific Prompts**

#### **Foundational Interfaces (prompt\_01...)**

* **Clear Contracts:** The initial prompt was designed to create a clean separation between the package's main public-facing interface (ContainerDeployer) and the internal, unexported interfaces (storageAPI, cloudRunAPI, etc.) that the orchestrator depends on, enabling testability from the start.

#### **Artifact Registry Helper (prompt\_02...)**

* **Integration Test for Idempotency:** The prompts for this standalone helper function specify an integration test that validates its real-world, idempotent behavior (i.e., it can be run multiple times without error).
* **Handling Long-Running Operations:** The "Green" prompt mandates that the implementation must wait for the CreateRepository long-running operation to complete, ensuring the resource is ready before proceeding.

#### **Cloud Run Adapter (prompt\_03...)**

* **Unit Testing for Internal Logic:** The "Red" prompt specifies a unit test to validate the adapter's internal logic, such as the create-vs-update branching and the translation of our generic DeploymentSpec into the specific Google Cloud Run configuration.
* **Polling for LROs:** The "Green" prompt requires the implementation to correctly poll and wait for the completion of long-running Create or Patch operations on the Cloud Run service.

#### **CloudBuildDeployer Orchestrator (prompt\_04...)**

* **Complex Build Logic:** The "Green" prompt mandates the specific, non-trivial Cloud Build configuration required to use Cloud Native Buildpacks (pack), including the critical preliminary step for handling monorepo builds by copying go.mod/go.sum files.
* **Source Code Packaging:** The prompts require the implementation to correctly package the source directory into a .tar.gz archive before uploading it to GCS for the build.
* **Full Pipeline Validation:** The integration test specified in the "Red" prompt is the most comprehensive in the project, requiring the creation of temporary source code, the execution of the full build-and-deploy pipeline, and polling the final service URL to verify it has become "Ready".
