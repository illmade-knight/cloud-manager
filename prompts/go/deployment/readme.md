### **Deployment Package: Corrected Refactor Plan**

Our goal is to create a full suite of robust, refined prompts for the deployment package by applying our established TDD methodology to each individual component within the package.

#### **Files to Produce**

The generation will proceed in a logical order, building foundational interfaces before the components that use them.

**1\. Foundational Prompts**

* **Prompt prompt\_00\_deployment\_preprompt.md:** The master context for the package, outlining the pipeline and architectural patterns.
* **Prompt prompt\_01\_deployment\_interfaces.md:** A prompt to generate all the necessary interface files that define the contracts for the package.

**2\. Component: Artifact Registry Helper**

* **Prompt prompt\_02\_artifacts\_red.md:** "Red" prompt to generate the integration test for the EnsureArtifactRegistryRepositoryExists function.
* **Prompt prompt\_02b\_artifacts\_green.md:** "Green" prompt to generate the artifacts.go implementation.

**3\. Component: Cloud Run Adapter**

* **Prompt prompt\_03\_cloudrun\_red.md:** "Red" prompt to generate the unit test for the CloudRunAPI adapter.
* **Prompt prompt\_03b\_cloudrun\_green.md:** "Green" prompt to generate the cloudrunadapter.go implementation.

**4\. Component: CloudBuild Deployer (Orchestrator)**

* **Prompt prompt\_04\_deployer\_red.md:** "Red" prompt specifying the creation of both a **unit test** (for orchestration logic) and an **integration test** (for the end-to-end pipeline).
* **Prompt prompt\_04b\_deployer\_green.md:** "Green" prompt to generate the complete CloudBuildDeployer implementation.

#### **Generated Go Code Files**

* serviceinterfaces.go: Contains the provider-agnostic interfaces like ICloudBuilder.
* containerdeployer.go: Contains the top-level ContainerDeployer interface.
* artifacts.go: Contains the standalone EnsureArtifactRegistryRepositoryExists logic.
* artifacts\_integration\_test.go: The integration test for the artifacts helper.
* cloudrunadapter.go: The concrete implementation for interacting with the Cloud Run Admin API.
* cloudrunadapter\_test.go: The unit test for the Cloud Run adapter.
* cloudbuilddeployer.go: The main orchestrator and its co-located internal adapters.
* cloudbuilddeployer\_test.go: The unit test for the deployer's orchestration logic.
* cloudbuilddeployer\_integration\_test.go: The integration test for the full build-and-deploy pipeline.
