### **Introduction: The Purpose and Intent of the IAM Refactor**

The primary goal of the iam package refactor was to apply our mature "Red-Green-Refine" methodology to a new and highly complex domain. Unlike the resource-specific managers, the IAM package must contend with significant inconsistencies across Google Cloud's various IAM APIs.

The intent of this refinement was therefore twofold:

1. **To Tame Complexity:** We aimed to create prompts that could successfully generate code for a sophisticated facade (GoogleIAMClient) that unifies dozens of different API calls and patterns. This required building strong guardrails into the prompts themselves to prevent the LLM from hallucinating or applying an IAM pattern from one service to another incorrectly.
2. **To Formalize a Robust Testing Strategy:** The iam components are critical for security and have complex internal logic. This phase saw the formalization of our **Hybrid Testing Strategy**, ensuring that internal logic is validated with precise unit tests, while real-world interactions are verified with comprehensive integration tests against live cloud services.

This process evolved our prompt suite from a simple instruction set into a sophisticated blueprint for generating secure, consistent, and highly-testable code for a complex problem domain.

### **IAM Package Prompt Changelog**

This changelog summarizes the creation and refinement of the full prompt suite for the iam package.

### **Core Process & Architectural Refinements**

* **Created the iam Preprompt (prompt\_00\_iam\_preprompt.md):** A master context prompt was created for the entire package. Its most critical function is to explicitly document and provide strict guardrails against Google Cloud's inconsistent IAM API patterns, aiming to prevent common LLM hallucinations.
* **Applied the Hybrid Testing Strategy:** This strategy was formally adopted for all complex adapters. The prompts now generate both **unit tests** for internal logic (like policy assembly, security checks, and request building) and **integration tests** for end-to-end validation against live APIs.
* **Standardized on testify/mock:** All unit tests for this package were specified to use the testify/mock library, continuing the standard we established.

### **Component-Specific Prompts**

#### **RolePlanner (prompt\_01...)**

* **Pure Logic TDD:** As a component with no external dependencies, prompts were created for a classic unit test TDD cycle.
* **Comprehensive Specification:** The "Red" prompt requires the test to build a complex architecture covering all known resource interactions (Pub/Sub, GCS, BQ, Firestore, Secrets, Dependencies) to ensure the planner's logic is thoroughly validated.

#### **IAMManager (prompt\_02...)**

* **Orchestration Logic Testing:** The prompts focus on testing the manager's core responsibility: orchestrating its dependencies.
* **Policy Assembly Validation:** The "Red" prompt requires the unit test to verify that the manager correctly assembles the flat list of bindings from the planner into a per-resource policy map, which is crucial for the atomic application of policies.

#### **GoogleIAMClient (Adapter) (prompt\_03...)**

* **Complex Logic Testing:** The hybrid test prompts were designed to cover this adapter's wide range of responsibilities.
    * The **unit test** prompt focuses on validating the internal switch statement logic and the special additive policy handling for Cloud Run.
    * The **integration test** prompt specifies a full lifecycle test (Apply \-\> Check \-\> Remove) on representative live resources, requiring robust prerequisite and cleanup management.

#### **GoogleIAMProjectClient (prompt\_04...)**

* **Safety-First Prompting:** The prompts for this sensitive component place a strong emphasis on security.
* **"Get-Modify-Set" Pattern:** The "Green" prompt explicitly mandates the safe "get-modify-set" pattern to prevent destructive overwrites of project-level IAM policies.
* **Security Guardrail Testing:** The "Red" prompt requires a unit test to validate the internal security check in the GrantFirestoreProjectRole method, ensuring it cannot be misused to grant non-datastore roles.

#### **BigQueryIAMManager (prompt\_05...)**

* **Architectural Re-scoping:** Following a review, this component was deprecated from the main automated flow to better adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege.
* **Prompts as an "Admin Tool":** The prompts were rewritten to generate this component as a standalone administrative tool, with tests and implementation focused on its quirky interaction with BigQuery's legacy dataset ACLs.
* **Deprecation Notice:** We designed a comprehensive comment block to be generated at the top of the file, documenting this architectural decision for future developers.

#### **Outlier Components (prompt\_06..., prompt\_07...)**

* **TestIAMClient:** A single "Green" prompt was created to generate this complex piece of test infrastructure, specifying the logic for a reusable service account pool to make integration tests more reliable.
* **iamroles.go Helpers:** A standard Red-\>Green TDD prompt pair was created to test and generate the standalone, idempotent GrantCloudRunAgentPermissions helper function.
