## Service Director:

* sdapp.go (Director): This is the core of the remote service. It's a stateful, event-driven application that listens for commands on Pub/Sub and uses its injected ServiceManager and IAMManager dependencies to perform the actual work. The use of a Functional Options Pattern for construction is a clean, advanced approach.

* sdconfig.go: This cleanly separates the configuration loading logic, handling both runtime flags/env vars and the discovery of Pub/Sub resources from the embedded resources.yaml file.

* sd_integration_test.go: This is an excellent integration test. It correctly isolates the Director's responsibility. It doesn't test the full stack; instead, it tests the transport and command handling layer. It uses a Pub/Sub emulator to verify that the Director correctly receives a command, calls the appropriate method on its mocked manager dependencies, and publishes a completion event.
