# **Prompt 12: Implementation for MessagingManager (RV_20250901)**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the `MessagingManager`. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined unit tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the `servicemanager/messagingmanager.go` file.

I have provided the `MessagingClient` interface and a complete unit test file (`messagingmanager_test.go`). Your implementation of the `MessagingManager` **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass. The implementation must call `client.Validate()` first, and use a `WaitGroup` with channels for concurrency.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer with deep experience in writing concurrent, robust, and production-grade cloud service clients.

**Overall Goal:** We are building the `servicemanager` package using a TDD approach. We have already written the unit tests that define the required behavior of the `MessagingManager`. Your task is now to write the implementation code that satisfies those tests.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **`servicemanager/messagingmanager.go`**. This file will contain the `MessagingManager` struct and its methods.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all the logic necessary to make the tests in the provided `messagingmanager_test.go` file pass. This includes:
    * **(L2-2.5) Pre-flight Validation:** The `CreateResources` method **must** call `m.client.Validate(resources)` as its very first operation and return the error immediately if validation fails.
    * **(L2-1.3) Idempotent Creation:** For both topics and subscriptions, you **must** get the resource handle and then call its `Exists()` method to determine whether to create a new resource or update an existing one.
    * **(L1-2.1) Two-Phase Creation & Teardown:** Creation must process all topics before processing any subscriptions. Teardown must process all subscriptions before processing any topics.
    * **(L2-1.3) Idempotent Teardown:** The `Teardown` logic **must** ignore "not found" errors when deleting resources. You will need a helper function like `isNotFound(err)` for this.
    * **(L2-1.4) Concurrency:** Use a `sync.WaitGroup` and dedicated channels for errors and provisioned resources for all concurrent operations.

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1.  **The Contract:** `servicemanager/messagingadapter.go`
2.  **The Specification:** `servicemanager/messagingmanager_test.go`
3.  **The Schema:** `servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go`

## Prompt Changelog

### RV_20250901

This revision updates the implementation instructions to generate more robust, production-ready code that aligns with the refined test specification.

#### Clean Architectural Refinements
* **Pre-flight Validation:** Mandated that `client.Validate()` must be called before any resource creation begins.
    * **Reason:** Enforces a fail-fast pattern, improving efficiency and fulfilling **L2-2.5 (Pre-flight & Validation)**.
* **Idempotency Logic:** Updated the required idempotency check to use `handle.Exists()` instead of a client-level method, and to ignore "not found" errors on teardown.
    * **Reason:** This aligns the manager with a consistent architectural pattern and robustly fulfills **L2-1.3 (Idempotency)**.

#### Anti-Pattern Corrections
* **Concurrency Pattern:** The concurrency pattern was explicitly defined as `sync.WaitGroup` with dedicated channels.
    * **Reason (Anti-Pattern Correction):** The initial, less-specific prompt could lead to a simple `errgroup` implementation that terminally fails. The new pattern is required to support the collection of partial successes, which better fulfills **L2-1.4 (Concurrency)**.
