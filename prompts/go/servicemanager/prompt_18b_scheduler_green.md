# **Prompt 18: Implementation for SchedulerManager (RV_20250901)**

**Objective:** Generate the complete implementation for the `CloudSchedulerManager`. The generated code must satisfy the previously defined unit tests.

**TDD Phase:** Green (Write the code to make the failing tests pass).

## **Primary Prompt (Concise)**

Your task is to generate the Go code for the `servicemanager/schedulermanager.go` file.

I have provided the `SchedulerClient` interface and a complete unit test file. Your implementation of the `CloudSchedulerManager` **must** make all the tests in the provided test file pass. The implementation must include a `Verify` method and use the `WaitGroup` and channels pattern for concurrency.

## **Reinforcement Prompt (Detailed Context)**

**Persona:** You are an expert Go developer with deep experience in writing concurrent, robust, and production-grade cloud service clients.

**Your Specific Task:** Your task is to generate the complete code for a single Go file: **`servicemanager/schedulermanager.go`**.

**Key Requirements to Fulfill:**

* **Pass All Tests:** This is the most critical requirement. Your generated code must correctly implement all logic to make the tests pass. This includes:
    * **(L2-2.5) Pre-flight Validation:** The `CreateResources` method **must** call `m.client.Validate(resources)` as its first operation and return immediately if validation fails.
    * **(L2-1.3) Idempotent Creation:** In `CreateResources`, you **must** get the job handle and then call its `Exists()` method to determine whether to create a new job or skip it.
    * **(L2-2.1) Teardown Protection:** The `Teardown` method **must** check the `TeardownProtection` flag before attempting to delete a job.
    * **(L2-1.3) Idempotent Teardown:** The `Teardown` logic **must** ignore "not found" errors when deleting jobs.
    * **(L1-2.1) Complete Interface:** You **must** implement the `Verify` method to check for the existence of all specified jobs.
    * **(L2-1.4) Concurrency:** Use a `sync.WaitGroup` and a dedicated error channel for all concurrent operations (`CreateResources`, `Teardown`, `Verify`).

**Dependencies (Full source code to be provided):**

1.  **The Contract:** `servicemanager/scheduleradapter.go`
2.  **The Specification:** `servicemanager/schedulermanager_test.go`
3.  **The Schema:** `servicemanager/systemarchitecture.go`

## Prompt Changelog

### RV_20250901

This revision updates the implementation instructions to ensure the manager is fully implemented and aligns with the project's consistent architectural patterns.

#### Clean Architectural Refinements
* **Added `Verify` Method:** The original prompt was missing the implementation requirement for the `Verify` method. This has been added to ensure the manager fully conforms to its expected interface, fulfilling **L1-2.1 (Infrastructure Provisioning)**.
* **Idempotent Teardown:** Required the implementation to ignore "not found" errors during deletion.
    * **Reason:** This makes the teardown operation resilient and correctly fulfills **L2-1.3 (Idempotency)**.

#### Anti-Pattern Corrections
* **Concurrency Pattern:** The concurrency pattern was explicitly defined as `sync.WaitGroup` with a dedicated error channel.
    * **Reason (Anti-Pattern Correction):** Enforces a consistent, robust pattern for **L2-1.4 (Concurrency)** across all managers.
